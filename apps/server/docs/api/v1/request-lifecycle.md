    Routes (routes.ts): The Front Door and Address. Defines where requests go (e.g., /auth/login, /auth/register). Connects the URL to the right person inside.

    Controller (controller.ts): The Receptionist/Traffic Director. Takes the incoming request, does quick checks (Did they bring the right basic forms?), directs the request to the correct department (Service), and tells the user the final outcome. It deals with the raw HTTP request and response.

    Service (service.ts): The Manager/Core Logic Department. Contains the actual business rules and orchestrates the process. How should a user actually be registered? Hash the password, check if the email exists, create the user record, maybe prepare a welcome email. It doesn't talk directly to the database details or the raw HTTP request.

    Repository (repository.ts): The Database Clerk/Storage Room Manager. Its only job is to talk to the database. Find a user by email, save a new user, update a user's token. It hides the specific database query details (SQL, NoSQL commands, ORM calls) from the Service.

    Validators (validators.ts): The Security Guard/Form Checker. Checks the incoming data thoroughly before it even gets to the Receptionist (Controller). Is the email a valid format? Is the password strong enough? Often implemented as middleware.

    Types (types.ts): The Blueprints/Definitions. Defines exactly what a "User" object looks like, what data is expected for login, etc. Essential for clarity and preventing errors, especially with TypeScript.

    Utils (utils.ts): The Toolbox. Contains reusable helper functions needed by different parts (e.g., a function to hash passwords, a function to generate tokens).
    
--------

    The typical flow for handling an incoming request that involves data interaction in this layered architecture is:

    Controller: Receives the incoming HTTP request (from Express). It handles request details like reading body/query params, validating input format, and determining what action needs to be done based on the request. It then delegates the core task to the Service layer. It doesn't know how the action is performed, just that it needs to be done.

    Service: Receives the request from the Controller. This is where the business logic lives. It orchestrates the operations required to fulfill the request. It knows what data is needed and how to process it according to the application's rules, but it doesn't know how to get or store the data. It delegates data access to the Repository layer.

    Repository: Receives the data access request from the Service. This layer is responsible for interacting directly with the Database. It knows how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using your chosen ORM (like Drizzle) or query builder. It translates service requests into database queries and database results back into a format the Service understands. It uses the database client (your db instance).

    Database: Receives the query from the Repository (via the Drizzle client). It performs the actual data storage or retrieval.
